    <p>The envelope arrived without a stamp, slipped beneath <span class="blurred">Tunde’s apartment
        door</span> sometime after midnight. His name was written in careful block letters, the kind
      used by people who didn’t want their handwriting recognized. Inside was a single
      photograph—grainy, black-and-white—showing him from across the street, taken just two evenings
      before. On the back, a message: “You kept the secret. So have I.” Tunde felt the room shrink
      around him.</p>
    <p>He tried to convince himself it was a prank, but <span class="blurred"> the second envelope
      </span> arrived the next day, this time on his office desk. No one saw who delivered it.
      Inside was a photocopy of an old newspaper clipping about a warehouse fire—an accident, the
      report had said.</p>
    <p>The third message came as a handwritten note slid into his car’s windshield wiper: “Meet me
      where it happened. Midnight.” When he arrived at the <span class="blurred">abandoned
        warehouse,</span> the air was still heavy with the scent of rust and rain</p>
